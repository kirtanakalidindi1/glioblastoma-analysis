# Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis of Glioblastoma Tumors

This project uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to explore tumor heterogeneity in glioblastoma (GBM) by analyzing three publicly available datasets. The study focuses on cell-type clustering, quality control, dimensionality reduction, and differential gene expression to identify tumor subpopulations and potential therapeutic biomarkers.

Developed collaboratively at Columbia University for ECBME4060: Introduction to Genomics Science and Technology.
